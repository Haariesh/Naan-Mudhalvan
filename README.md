# Noise Pollution Monitoring Project

## Overview

The Noise Pollution Monitoring Project is an initiative to deploy IoT sensors in public areas for real-time noise level monitoring. The project aims to raise awareness about noise pollution, ensure compliance with noise regulations, and improve the quality of life in urban areas. This repository contains information and code related to the project's objectives, IoT sensor design, noise pollution information platform development, and integration using IoT technology and Python.

## Project Objectives

- **Real-time Noise Pollution Monitoring:** Measure noise levels in public areas and provide real-time data.
- **Public Awareness:** Educate the public about noise pollution and its impact on health and well-being.
- **Noise Regulation Compliance:** Help local authorities and communities ensure noise regulation compliance.
- **Improved Quality of Life:** Contribute to a quieter and more pleasant urban environment.

## IoT Sensor Design

- Describe the deployment plan for IoT noise sensors in various public areas.
- Include details on the sensor types, data collection frequency, and power source.

## Noise Pollution Information Platform

- Detail the design of the web-based platform and mobile app for displaying real-time noise level data.
- Mention the technologies used, user interface design, and user accessibility features.

## Integration Approach

- Explain how IoT sensors send data to the noise pollution information platform.
- Provide code snippets or integration diagrams to illustrate the data flow.

## Installation

- Provide step-by-step instructions for setting up the project locally, including any dependencies.

## Usage

- Explain how to use the platform and interact with the IoT sensors.

## Contributing

- Outline guidelines for contributing to the project, including reporting issues and making pull requests.

## License

- Specify the project's open-source license, if applicable.

## Acknowledgments

- Give credit to contributors, libraries, or tools used in the project.

## Contact
